INTRODUCTION:
In computing, encryption is the method by which
plaintext or any other type of data is converted from
a readable form to an encoded version that can only
be decoded by another entity if they have access to a
decryption key. Encryption is one of the most
important methods for providing data security,
especially for end-to-end protection of data
transmitted across networks.
